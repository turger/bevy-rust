# Simple game made with Bevy and Rust

This is a simple game made with Bevy and Rust. It is a platformer game where the player can jump and move around. 

This code is made with Cursor AI editor with no prior knowledge of Bevy or Rust.

The base was forked from my colleague's [anttiz](https://github.com/anttiz) repository and I continued to build on top of it.
